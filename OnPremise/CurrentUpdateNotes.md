| Migration Assistant Tool | The [Migration Assistant](Administrators/MigratingData.html) tool was created by Splice Machine to help migrate your database to a new version of the Splice Machine software. You run it before upgrading your software to export your database to file, and then run it after upgrading your software to import an upgraded version of your database.             |
| Pinned Tables            
 (RDD Caching)             | You can now use the <span class="CodeFont">[PIN TABLE](../Shared/SQLReference/Statements/PinTable.html)</span> statement to cache a static version of a table in memory, and use the <span class="CodeFont">[UNPIN TABLE](../Shared/SQLReference/Statements/UnpinTable.html)</span> statement to delete the cached version of the table.

| Updated Connectors       | Splice Machine has added enhancements to our JDBC and ODBC drivers for improved performance and added features.

| 2.0             | Data Import changes            | Our data import technology was modified for improved performance and error handling.

| 2.0             | Timestamps in imported data    | Previous versions of Splice Machine were "lenient" with regard to parsing timestamps when importing data:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                    -   Timestamp data in imported columns must now match the formatting pattern you specify in the <span class="CodeFont">IMPORT</span> or <span class="CodeFont">UPSERT</span> call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                    -   All timestamp values in a file being imported must now use the same timestamp format; multiple timestamp formats in a file are no longer supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                    -   Splice Machine now uses only one default pattern: <span class="CodeFont">yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss</span>, which specifies a 24-hour clock and no fractions of seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 2.0             | Schema owner                   | The owner of a schema can now be changed by the current schema owner:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2.0             | Spark engine                   | As described in the Performance Enhancements section above, we now use Spark for greatly improved query execution performance for analytical queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
