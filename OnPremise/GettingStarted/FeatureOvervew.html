                            <p class="noSpaceAbove">As part of its automatic auto-sharding functionality, HBase horizontally partitions or splits each table into smaller chunks or shards that are distributed across multiple servers. </p>
                            <p>This allows Splice Machine to deliver massive parallelization for predicates, joins, aggregations, and functions by pushing computations down to each distributed data shard. Splice Machine accomplishes this by placing its parser, planner, optimizer, and executor component on each HBase node.</p>
                            <p>By using HBase co-processors to distribute the computation across shards, Splice Machine delivers parallel query processing without the need for MapReduce.</p>

Then, on a periodic basis, we delete the actual records during the compaction process, which is scheduled depending on workload and performance requirements.</td>

                            <p class="noSpaceAbove">Splice Machine is highly integrated with the Hadoop ecosystem, with HDFS and HBase being key parts of Splice Machine's architecture. All Apache ecosystem players like Flume and Sqoop, for loading data into HDFS, work well with your Splice Machine database. </p>
                            <p>Splice Machine supports federated queries. You can use our virtual table interface (VTI) to access external data sources from within Splice Machine, and you can use HCatalog to access your Splice Machine database from other sources.See the <a href="../../Shared/Developers/Fundamentals/UsingVTI.html">Using the Splice Machine Virtual Table Interface (VTI)</a> topic in our <span class="ItalicFont">Developer's Guide</span> for more information.</p>

                        <td>
                            <p class="noSpaceAbove">Splice Machine provides full ACID (<span class="BoldFont">A</span>tomicity, <span class="BoldFont">C</span>onsistency, <span class="BoldFont">I</span>solation, <span class="BoldFont">D</span>urability) transactions across rows and tables. We use a lockless snapshot isolation design that uses Multiple Version Concurrency Control (<span class="ItalicFont">MVCC</span>) to create a new version of the record every time it is updated. Transactions can span a large number of operations. Because Splice Machine does not use locking during transactions, no penalty is imposed for fairly large transactions.</p>
                            <p>Snapshot isolation is designed to improve concurrency and consistency in a database by maintaining different versions of data: an executing transaction operates on what seems to be a personal snapshot of the database that was taken at the start of the transaction. Then, when the transaction is complete and ready to commit, the commit is only successful if the values updated by the transaction have not been changed externally since the snapshot was taken (since the beginning of the transaction). </p>
                            <p>We also support nested transactions, which makes it easy to gracefully handle node failures during large updates.</p>
                            <p>For more information about transaction handling in Splice Machine, see <span class="ItalicFont"><a href="../../Shared/Developers/Fundamentals/Transactions.html">Running Transactions</a></span> in our <span class="ItalicFont">Developer's Guide</span>.</p>

                        <td>Splice Machine uses HBase as the data storage layer, which automatically includes data redundancy. Data is replicated, by default, to three nodes. Any two of these nodes can go down without data loss. In addition, HBase will automatically rebuild a node once it is replaced.</td>

Splice Machine supports integration with the LDAP v3 standard, allowing users to be validated against an LDAP-supported directory service.
</p>
                            <p>
And Splice Machine also provides support for roles and privileges, which allows for specific users to be assigned roles, which can be granted privileges for read/update to database objects at both the table and column level.
