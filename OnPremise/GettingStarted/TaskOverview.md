| []()Running Transactions                   | Splice Machine is a fully transactional database. This allows you to perform actions such as <span class="ItalicFont">commit</span> and <span class="ItalicFont">rollback</span>, which means that in a transactional context, the database does not make changes visible to others until a <span class="ItalicFont">commit</span> has been issued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                              Splice Machine enforces consistency using <span class="ItalicFont">Snapshot Isolation</span>, which is used in conjunction with transaction processing. Snapshot isolation in a database essentially guarantees that every read made during a transaction will see a consistent snapshot of the database, and that the transaction itself can only commit if none of the updates it has made conflict with other (concurrent) updates made to the database while the transaction was in process.

| []()Stored Procedures and Functions        | The purpose of a <span class="BoldFont">stored procedure</span> is generally geared toward checking business rules and validating data before performing actions, or performing any significant processing of data with the inputs to the procedure. In its simplest form, a stored procedure is a set of code that can be executed over and over again. It can be a simple set of SQL statements or logic but it can also contain extensive or complex logic that requires execution of several SQL statements. In Splice Machine, stored procedures are invoked with a <span class="CodeFont">CALL</span> statement and can issue <span class="CodeFont">UPDATE</span>, <span class="CodeFont">INSERT</span>, and <span class="CodeFont">DELETE</span> statements; however, they cannot be used in <span class="CodeFont">SELECT</span> statements. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                              The main purpose of a <span class="BoldFont">function</span> is to do a small bit of processing, a query, or some formatting, and then return a value. A Splice Machine function must be written in Java as a public static method, always returns a value, and cannot modify data in the database; functions <span class="ItalicFont">can</span> used in <span class="CodeFont">SELECT</span> statements.

| []()Using HCatalog with Splice Machine     | Apache HCatalog is a metadata and table management system for the broader Hadoop platform. HCatalog’s table abstraction presents users with a relational view of data in the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) and ensures that users need not worry about where or in what format their data is stored. HCatalog supports reading and writing files in any format for which a SerDe (serializer-deserializer) can be written.This makes it possible for you to use data processing tools such as Apache Pig, Apache MapReduce, and Apache Hive to easily read and write data on your cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                              Splice Machine integrates with HCatalog, allowing any HiveQL statements to read from (e.g. <span class="CodeFont">SELECT</span>) and write to (e.g. <span class="CodeFont">INSERT</span>) Splice Machine tables. You can also use joins and unions to combine native Hive tables with Splice Machine tables.

| []()Viewing Statement Logs                 | Splice Machine uses the open source [Apache log4j Logging API](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html) to maintain logs of database activity. Among the capabilities you can take advantage of are the ability to configure individual loggers to log specific message levels, and the ability to associate a logger object with any java class. For more information about logging, see the <span class="ItalicFont">[Splice Machine Logging](../../Shared/Developers/TuningAndDebugging/UsingLogging.html)</span> section in our <span class="ItalicFont">Administrator's Guide</span>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
