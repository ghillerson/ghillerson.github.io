[]()Features of the Splice Machine Management Console
=====================================================

This section summarizes the use of major features of the management console interface, including:

-   [Drilling Down](#Drilling)
-   [Switching Views](#Switchin)
-   [Hovering](#Hovering)
-   [Refreshing the View](#Refreshi)
-   [Zooming the Timeline View](#Zooming)

[]()Drilling Down
-----------------

In general, you can click anything that displays in blue (<span class="ConsoleLink">like this</span>) to drill down into a more detailed view. For example, clicking <span class="ConsoleLink">Explain</span> in the following description from the completed jobs table will drill down into the job details for <span class="ItalicFont">Job 113</span>:

You can continue to drill down from there to reveal increasing levels of detail.

[]()Switching Views
-------------------

You can quickly switch to a different view by clicking a tab in the tab bar at the top of the console screen. The <span class="AppCommand">Jobs</span> tab is selected in this screen shot:

### []()Hovering

You can hover the cursor over interface element links, like the <span class="ConsoleLink">Event Timeline</span> drop-down in the following image, to display a screen tip for the item:

Similarly, you can hover over the ? to display the definition for a term, like the definition of a job:

<img src="../../Resources/Images/SparkUIHover2.png" alt="Hovering over a question mark in the console UI to see the definition of a term" class="indentedTightSpacing" />

And you can hover over an event in timeline display to see summary information; for example:

<img src="../../Resources/Images/SparkUITimelineHover.png" alt="Hovering over a timeline event for summary information" class="indentedTightSpacing" />

[]()Refreshing the View
-----------------------

Currently, the console does not automatically or periodically refresh the view.

If you're monitoring an active job, you'll need to refresh your browser window to view the latest activity.

[]()Zooming the Timeline View
-----------------------------

When you're viewing an event timeline, you can <span class="ConsoleLink">Enable zooming</span>, which allows you to use mouse or touch gestures to zoom in on a portion or a timeline, zoom out, or scroll through the timeline.
