            <p>This topic introduces the  <span class="ItalicFont">Splice Machine Management Console</span>, a browser-based tool that you can use to monitor database queries on your cluster in real time. The Console UI&#160;allows you to see the Spark queries that are currently running in Splice Machine on your cluster, and to then drill down into each job to see the current progress of the queries, and to identify any potential bottlenecks. If you see something amiss, you can also terminate a query.</p>
            <p class="noteIcon">The <span class="ItalicFont">Splice Machine Management Console</span> leverages the Spark cluster manager <span class="ItalicFont">Web UI</span>, which is described here:&#160;<a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html" target="_blank">http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html</a>.</p>
            <p>This chapter is organized into the following topics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">The next section, <a href="#About">About the Splice Machine Management Console</a>, tells you about the management console, including how to access it in your browser.</li>
                <li value="2">The <a href="ConsoleFeatures.html">Features of the Splice Machine Management Console</a> topic describes how to use major features of the console interface.</li>
                <li value="3">The <a href="ManagingQueries.html">Managing Queries with the Console</a> topic shows you how to review and monitor the progress of your Spark jobs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="About"></a>About the Splice Machine Management Console</h2>
            <p>The  <span class="ItalicFont">Splice Machine Spark Management Console</span> is a browser-based tool that you can use to watch your active Spark queries execute and to review the execution of completed queries. You can use the console to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">View any completed jobs</li>
                <li value="2">Monitor active jobs as they execute</li>
                <li value="3">View a timeline chart of the events in a job and its stages</li>
                <li value="4">View a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)&#160;visualization of a job's stages and the tasks within each stage</li>
                <li value="5">Monitor persisted and cached storage in realtime</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can access the Splice&#160;Machine Management Console by pointing your browser at this URL:</p>
            <div class="preWrapper"><pre class="AppCommand"><span class="PlatformVariablesSpliceMgmtConsoleUrl">http://localhost:4040</span></pre>
            </div>
            <p class="noteNote" data-mc-autonum="NOTE: &#160;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="noteAutoNum">NOTE: &#160;</span></span>The management console URL&#160;will only be active after you've run at least one query on our Spark engine; prior to using the Spark engine, your browser will report an error such as <span class="ItalicFont">Connection Refused</span>.</p>
            <p>Here are some of the terms you'll encounter while using the management console:</p>

                            <p>In FAIR&#160;scheduling, Spark assigns tasks between jobs in a round robin manner, meaning that all jobs get a roughly equal share of the available cluster resources.
