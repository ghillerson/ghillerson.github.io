[]()Identifier Types
====================

This topic describes the different types of SQLIdentifiers that are used in this manual. .

Complete syntax, including information about case sensitivity and special character usage in SQL Identifier types, is found in the [SQL Identifier Syntax](IdentifierSyntax.html) topic in this section.

We use a number of different identifier types in the SQL Reference Manual, all of which are <span class="CodeFont">SQLIdentifiers</span>. Some can be qualified with schema, table, or correlation names, as described in the following table:

| []()Authorization Identifier | []()An <span class="CodeFont">Authorization Identifier</span> is an <span class="CodeFont">SQLIdentifier</span> that represents the name of the user when you specify one in a connection request, otherwise known as a user name. When you connect with a user name, that name becomes the default schema name; if you do not specify a user name in the connect request, the default user name and <span class="CodeFont">schemaName</span> is <span class="CodeFont">SPLICE</span>. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                User names can be case-sensitive within the authentication system, but they are always case-insensitive within Splice Machine's authorization system unless they are delimited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

[]()Column Name Notes
---------------------

Column names are either <span class="CodeFont">simple-column-Name</span> identifiers, which cannot be qualified, or <span class="CodeFont">column-Name</span> identifiers that can be qualified with a <span class="CodeFont">table-Name</span> or <span class="CodeFont">correlation-Name</span>. Here's the syntax:

``` FcnSyntax
[ { table-Name | correlation-Name } . ] SQLIdentifier
```

In some circumstances, you must use a <span class="CodeFont">simple-column-Name</span> and cannot qualify the column name:

-   When creating a table ([<span class="CodeFont">CREATE TABLE</span> statement](../Statements/CreateTable.html)).
-   In a column's <span class="CodeFont">correlation-Name</span> in a <span class="CodeFont">[SELECT expression](../Expressions/Select.html)</span>
-   In a column's<span class="CodeFont">correlation-Name</span> in a <span class="CodeFont">[TABLE expression](../Expressions/Table.html)</span>

[]()Correlation Name Notes
--------------------------

You cannot use a correlation name for columns that are listed in the <span class="CodeFont">FOR UPDATE</span> list of a <span class="CodeFont">SELECT</span>. For example, in the following:

``` Example
SELECT Average AS corrCol1, Homeruns AS corrCol2, Strikeouts
   FROM Batting 
   FOR UPDATE of Average, Strikeouts;
```

-   You cannot use <span class="CodeFont">corrColl1</span> as a correlation name for <span class="CodeFont">Average</span> because <span class="CodeFont">Average</span> is listed in the <span class="CodeFont">FOR UPDATE</span> list.
-   You can use <span class="CodeFont">corrCol2</span> as a correlation name for <span class="CodeFont">HomeRuns</span> because the <span class="CodeFont">HomeRuns</span> column is not in the update list.
