==========================================================================

Boolean expressions are allowed in <span class="CodeFont">[WHERE](../Clauses/Where.html)</span> clauses and in check constraints. Boolean expressions in check constraints have limitations not noted here; see [<span class="CodeFont">CONSTRAINT clause</span>](../Clauses/Constraint.html) for more information. Boolean expressions in a <span class="CodeFont">WHERE</span> clause have a highly liberal syntax; see <span class="CodeFont">WHERE clause</span>, for example.

A Boolean expression can include zero or more Boolean operators.

Syntax

The following table shows the syntax for the Boolean operators
