====================================================================

This section lists all of the Splice Machine reserved words, including those in the SQL standard. Splice Machine will return an error if you use any of these keywords as an identifier name unless you surround the identifier name with quotes ("). See [SQL Identifier Syntax](../Identifiers/IdentifierSyntax.html#SQL92Rules).
