| <span class="ItalicFont">REST</span>                                | <span class="BoldFont">RE</span>presentational <span class="BoldFont">S</span>tate <span class="BoldFont">T</span>ransfer. A simple, stateless, client-server protocol use for networked applications, which uses the HTTP requests to communicate among machines. RESTful applications use HTTP requests to post (create or update) data, to read data, and to delete data. Collectively, these are known as CRUD operations.   |
| <span class="ItalicFont">Rollback</span>                            | An operation that returns the database to some previous state, typically used for recovering from database server crashes: by rolling back any transaction that was active at the time of the crash, the database is restored to a consistent state.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| <span class="ItalicFont">Scale Out</span>                           | A database architecture that doesn’t rely on a single controller and scales by adding processing power coupled with additional storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| <span class="ItalicFont">Scale Up</span>                            | An architecture that uses a fixed controller resource for all processing. Scaling capacity happens by adding processing power to the controller or (eventually) upgrading to a new (and expensive) controller.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| <span class="ItalicFont">Sharding</span>                            | Horizontal partitioning in a database: that the data is split among multiple machines while ensuring that the data is always accessed from the correct place. See Auto-sharding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| <span class="ItalicFont">Spark</span>                               | Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework that uses in-memory primitives to reduce storage access and boost database performance. Spark allows user applications to load data into a cluster's memory and repeatedly query that data.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| <span class="ItalicFont">Trigger</span>                             | A database trigger is code that is run automatically in response to specific events on specific tables or views in your database. Triggers are typically configured to maintain data integrity, such as ensuring that an updated value is in range.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <span class="ItalicFont">YARN</span>                                | <span class="ItalicFont"><span class="BoldFont">Y</span>et <span class="BoldFont">A</span>nother <span class="BoldFont">R</span>esource <span class="BoldFont">N</span>egotiator</span>. YARN assigns CPU, memory, and storage to applications running on a Hadoop cluster, and  enables application frameworks other than MapReduce (like Spark) to run on Hadoop.                                                              |
| <span class="ItalicFont">ZooKeeper</span>                           | Part of the Apache Hadoop framework, ZooKeeper provides a centralized infrastructure and services that enable synchronization across a cluster. ZooKeeper maintains common objects needed in large cluster environments. Examples of these objects include configuration information, hierarchical naming space, and so on. Applications can leverage these services to coordinate distributed processing across large clusters. |
